## monorepo to host frontend and server for recipes

#### Seed Data

just run the seed command which will start the seeding data,
it will take time as Edamam API only allows 5 calls in a minute
and so the data is received very slowly and stored in MongoDB

#### Frontend

the front end currently has a view that allows for search and
renders MUI Card Element per each recipe.
